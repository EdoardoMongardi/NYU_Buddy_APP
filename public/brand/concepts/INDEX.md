# Logo Concepts (Phase 3 - Variations C & F)

This document contains brief notes on the 6 refined concept variations for the NYU Buddy app based on your selections of C and F.

## Concept C: Path & Destination Variations

### C1: Abstract Journey Map
Retaining the feeling of a destination and path, C1 heavily distorts the "B" shape into a continuous route ending at a terminal pin drop. It completely moves away from being a literal letter.

### C2: Route Pin Cluster
C2 removes the path entirely and focuses on the intersection of travel routes converging on a single, clear destination pin. Clean circular geometry, extremely scalable at 24px and 32px.

### C3: Linked Route Points
C3 takes the dual loops of the original "B" and reinterprets them as two linked map locations. It's highly abstracted but hints at the start and end of a journey together.

## Concept F: Container Variations

### F1: Open Ring Meetup
F1 pulls away from the squircle frame, using an open, embracing ring that gently orbits two solid inner nodes (buddies meeting up in the center).

### F2: Expanding Geofence Frame
F2 utilizes a broken, dashed line forming a soft squircle, suggesting a predefined radius or geofence. The inside contains a radiating pulse around a core meeting point.

### F3: Offset Buddy Connections
F3 uses an elongated pill-squircle frame (distinctly un-camera-like). The internal design features two buddy nodes offset with a faint connecting track sliding between them.
